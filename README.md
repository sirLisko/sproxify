Sproxify intercepts Spotify links and let you choose where to play it.

So it doesnâ€™t matter if you are a Spotify webapp user or a canonical desktop one: through a fancy-looking button, Sproxify redirects you in the desiderated environment where you can finally play your music. Just where you want!
